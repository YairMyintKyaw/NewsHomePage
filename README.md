## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The major things I have learned while developing the website is that layouting the whole webiste using flex box and making it responsive.
Moreover, I have learnt how to make the font size responsive using calc() and vw.

### Continued development

I think I need to be good at both grid and flexbox. It would be better if grid is used to layout the website. Currently, I have used flexbox to layout the whole website.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This website help me understand more things on html css and js. I have read a lot on the site while I don't understand the things very well. It assists a lot while developing.
